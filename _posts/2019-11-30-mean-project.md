### What is Angular? (for front-end)
a Client-Side (Browser) Framework which allows you to build Single-Page-Applications   
* render UI with dynamic data
* handle user input   
* communicate with backend services   
### What is Node? (for back-end)    
a Server-side library: JavaScript on the Server-side   
* listen to requests and send resonses
* execute server-side logic
* interact with databases and files
### What is Express?(framework of Node)   
a Node framework wich simplifies writing server-side code and logic   
* based on Node, offers same functionalities   
* middlewarebased funnerl requests through functions   
* includes routing, view-rendering & more   
### What is MongoDB?(database)   
a NoSQL database which stores 'Documents' in Collections' instead of 'Records' and 'Tables' as in SQL   
* store application data 
* enforces no data schema orrelations
* easily connected to Node/Express (not to Angular: risky to expose data in browser where data can easily be hacked)   
### SPA
the whole user interface is handled as one page only which is  dynamically re-rendered all the time by Angular   
single page is not necessarily served by Node backend
