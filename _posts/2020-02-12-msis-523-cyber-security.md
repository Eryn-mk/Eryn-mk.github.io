* only patents and copyrights are called out in US constitution

## copyrights

creates certin exclusive rights in 'priginal works of authorship' that are fixed in a **tangible** form of expression:

life of author 70 years,

## patents
* compromise for a monopolu

* right to **exclude**

* trade secrets require you to sue the people (there should be a person, if you don't know who to sue...issue)
* most powerful, long life, but fragile

* trade secrets and blckchain
* evidence of pocession: document hashing, zero knowledge proofs
* 1992, called Timechain
* Zero knowledge proofs
    * Alibaba's Cave example
    * completeness: if the statement is ture, the verifier will be convinvced of this fact by an prover
    * Soundness: if the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the verifier that it is true

* #### NDA cover what?    
 non-public business information, trade secret
 Some common issues addressed in an NDA include:[6]

 outlining the parties to the agreement;
the definition of what is confidential, i.e. the information to be held confidential. Modern NDAs will typically include a laundry list of types of items which are covered, including unpublished patent applications, know-how, schema, financial information, verbal representations, customer lists, vendor lists, business practices/strategies, etc.;
the disclosure period – information not disclosed during the disclosure period (e.g., one year after the date of the NDA) is not deemed confidential;
the exclusions from what must be kept confidential

1. Unilateral
2. Employment
3. Mutual
    * Mutual IP NDA
    * Mutual
    * Targeted Purpose
    * Correct Scope
    * Proper Duration(s)
    * Special Clauses
4. NNN (Non-disclosure, Non-use, and Non-circumvention)

 **rivalrous property**: one person's use precludes another's. If i drink the milk, you cannot.      
 **excludable property**: property from which others can easily be exclude or kept out. "this is my field. no trepassing"
* #### in Thomas Jefferson opinions, what is 'inventions'?  
 "He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper ai mine, receives light without darkening me"
The Patent Act of 1793, authored by Thomas Jefferson, defined statutory subject matter as     
  “any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new or useful improvement [thereof].”
* #### What does "To promote the progress of science and useful arts" refer to?     
 **the patent and copyright clause**    
        
 Intellectual Property: 
* Patents
* Copyrights 
* Trademarks 
* Trade Secrets
* “Knowhow”

 
* #### Before 2016 in the U.S.A trade secret law was?       
 Until 2016, the civil law of trade secrecy was **a matter of state law**     
 The main sources:      
 Restatement (First) of Torts (1939) and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“UTSA”), the most recently amended version of which dates from 1985.1 In turn, states relied on those two basic frameworks in creating their own law of trade
secrecy, both by statute and in the courts.
* #### In the U.S.A. trade secrets can protect?
 Copyright patent trademark **tradesecret**
* #### What does 'A Zero Knowledge Proof's Completeness' mean?         
   **completeness**: if the statement is ture, the verifier will be convinvced of this fact by an prover      
 Soundness: if the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the verifier that it is true        
 zero-knowledge: if the statement is true, no verifier learns anything otherthan the fact that the stateent is true         
* #### Percentage of the Internet that makes up the "deep web" is **99%**
* #### The oldest form of protection for valuable information is **Roman Law**       
Since the early days of communication, diplomats and military commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands
* #### E.I. du Pont de Nemours Powder Co. et al. v. Masland et al.的case中为什么misappropriate trade secrets?        
The defendant shall not fraudulently **abuse the trust** reposed in him. It is the usual incident of
confidential relations. The defendang knows the facts(secrets) through the confidence that he accepted.

* #### Apple认为Harmony侵犯到了他们什么?  
 **Intellectual Property????**     
They had broken into the idea of an iPod.              
Apple’s actual words were: “When we
update our iPod software from time to time, 
it is highly likely that Real’s Harmony technology will cease to work with current and future iPods.”)
s.      
“We are stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod, and we
are investigating the implications of their actions under the DMCA [Digital Millennium
Copyright Act] and other laws.”       

They had broken into the idea of an iPod. (I imagine a small, Pla- tonic white rectangle, presumably imbued with the spirit of Steve Jobs.) 
Their true sin was trying to understand the iPod so that they could make it do things that Apple did not want it to do. 
Beyond that, though, innovators actually come to believe that they have the moral right to control the uses of their goods after they are sold. This isn’t your iPod, it’s Apple’s iPod. Yet even if they believe this, we don’t have to agree.

* #### 地上掉落的苹果，什么时候才真正属于那个人？
 when he **gather** the apple
